/* Objects */

// This is the first layer with class-based selectors. It contains styles for non-cosmetic
// objects such as containers, wrappers and layout systems. This layer also affects less of
// the DOM than the elements layer, has a higher specificity, and is slightly more explicit 
// given that we are now targeting specific sections of the DOM with classes.
